                <h2>DO I NEED A VISA TO VISIT ISRAEL?</h2>
                <p>We welcome visitors to Israel. Many countries have a Visa Waiver Program with Israel, which allows their citizens to visit Israel without a need for a visa. Before embarking on a trip, visitors desiring to stop in Israel on their way to other destinations must check if they need a pre-arranged tourist visa.</p>

                <h2>ISN’T ISRAEL A LONG WAY AWAY?</h2>
                <p>Not nearly as far as you may think: just 10 hours from New York (it’s quicker to fly from New York to Israel than from New York to Hawaii!), or 14 hours from Los Angeles. There are about ten nonstop flights a day from North America to Israel, on Air Canada, American Airlines/US Airways, Delta, El Al Israel Airlines and United. Plus you can connect to Israel through dozens of European cities.</p>

                <h2>WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED TO TRAVEL TO ISRAEL?</h2>
                <p>For U.S. and Canadian citizens, all you need is a passport that’s valid at least six months longer than your date of arrival in Israel. (For stays up to three months, you don’t need a visa.) If you’re not a U.S. or Canadian citizen, the same conditions apply to citizens of most western countries.</p>

                <h2>IS IT SAFE TO TRAVEL TO ISRAEL?</h2>
                <p>We wouldn’t urge you to come if it wasn’t. Every year between 3 and 4 million tourists vacation in Israel – and apart from those who fall in love with an Israeli – or with Israel – they all go home again safe and sound. The planes of 90+ airlines wouldn’t fly to Israel if it weren’t safe.</p>

                <h2>WHAT TO WEAR?</h2>
                <p>Like almost everywhere in the world, casual is the "rule" for everyday sightseeing. Bring good walking shoes or sneakers and "layers." Israelis (especially women) like to be “elegant casual” on evenings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Some religious shrines require modest dress (arms and legs covered, and, occasionally, no pants for women). Don't forget your swimsuit and, for the Dead Sea, plastic shoes or aqausox.</p>
